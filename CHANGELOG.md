# Changelog

## 1.5.14 — 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **Empty Wishlist right after launch**: the very first Journal refresh
  after starting ED-Frame could occasionally resolve the correct active
  ship but publish an empty Wishlist, even though real plans existed for
  it - only fixed by restarting the app. The fleet/CAPI snapshot behind
  ship-to-label resolution isn't always fully settled on that first
  pass. ED-Frame now retries once, automatically, only on that first
  refresh after launch, if it sees a resolved ship with an unexpectedly
  empty Wishlist.

## 1.5.13 — 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **Crash on startup after database corruption**: if `data_history.sqlite3`
  (the local cache for EDDN/mining/HGE history and credit snapshots) was
  ever left with malformed pages - most likely from a hard process kill
  or crash mid-write - ED-Frame would fail to start at all, every time,
  with an unhandled database error. This cache is never the source of
  truth (your Journal and Wishlist data live in separate files and were
  never at risk), so ED-Frame now detects corruption automatically,
  keeps the broken file as a timestamped backup next to it, and rebuilds
  a fresh, working database instead of crashing.

## 1.5.12 — 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- **Crash on save**: any local save (EDDN config, Wishlist plans, UI
  settings, etc.) could crash the app with "the process cannot access
  the file because it is being used by another process" when antivirus,
  Windows Search indexing, or OneDrive briefly opened the file right
  after it changed. ED-Frame now retries a save a few times over a
  fraction of a second before giving up, which absorbs this kind of
  momentary lock instead of crashing.

## 1.5.11 — 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **Build import**: applying an imported build to the Wishlist could
  fail with "target ship no longer matches the preview" even when the
  correct target ship was selected — affecting any ship whose Frontier
  symbol differs from its display name (Python Mk II / `python_nx`,
  Caspian Explorer / `Explorer_NX`). The preview step already resolved
  this correctly via the ship catalog's alias table; the final "Apply
  to Wishlist" step used a separate, naive text comparison that could
  never match for these ships. Apply now reuses the same alias-aware
  matching as the preview.

## 1.5.10 — 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- The local history database (`data_history.sqlite3`, WAL-mode SQLite
  used for EDDN/mining/HGE archival) could grow far beyond its actual
  content — observed at over 1 GB on disk for barely 30 MB of real
  data. SQLite normally reclaims this itself once the last open
  connection closes, but several background threads (EDDN, mining
  sync, credit snapshots) each open their own short-lived connections,
  so there is rarely a moment with none open to trigger that - and a
  non-graceful exit (a forced process kill, a crash, a power loss)
  skips it entirely, leaving the bloat in place until something
  explicitly reclaims it. ED-Frame now runs a checkpoint on startup,
  so a bloated database from a previous bad exit is cleaned up
  automatically every time - no manual intervention needed.

## 1.5.9 — 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- **Journal refresh performance**: every refresh (roughly every 1.2–2
  seconds while flying, whenever anything at all changed in the
  Journal) was recomputing several projections — Missions, Exobiology,
  Engineer unlock signals, the Tech Broker guide, Powerplay — from the
  Commander's *entire* career Journal history every single time.
  Profiled against a real, months-long Journal (158k+ events) this cost
  roughly 900ms of CPU time per refresh; because Python holds the GIL
  during that work, it could make the whole interface feel sluggish
  regardless of what you were doing (dragging the sidebar, opening a
  dropdown, switching tabs), not just on any one page. These
  projections are now cached against the Journal's own change
  revision and only recomputed when the underlying event stream
  actually changed — cutting a typical refresh to roughly 300ms in the
  same test. Functions with real side effects (Wishlist migration,
  Engineer-craft reconciliation, blueprint-ID learning) or that also
  depend on `Status.json` (which the game updates roughly once a
  second on its own) were deliberately left uncached to avoid trading
  smoothness for stale or skipped updates.

## 1.5.8 — 2026-09-19

### Added

- **Power Plant budget** on the Engineering page: a live bar showing
  total power draw against the installed Power Plant's output, plus
  five Priority-group indicators that highlight exactly which groups
  Frontier's own cascade (lowest priority shut down first) would
  disable on overload. Base module power figures are ED-Frame's own
  re-expression of the underlying game facts (not a copy of any
  third-party data file), combined with each module's own known
  engineering grade and experimental effect using the same
  sequential-multiplier math the game itself uses. A small number of
  modules with no published power figures anywhere yet (the classic
  Size-8 Frame Shift Drive, the Size-1 Class-B Shield Generator, and
  the Large/Mk II Large Planetary Vehicle Hangar) are reported as
  unknown rather than guessed.
- **Missions & Community Goals** page: a read-only view of currently
  accepted missions (reward, destination, time left) and joined
  Community Goals (contribution, tier reached, percentile rank),
  built entirely from Journal events - nothing is sent back to the
  game, and missions/goals cannot be accepted, abandoned or turned in
  from here. Delivery-by-Cargo-Depot and salvage-collection missions
  show a real progress bar; Frontier does not journal step-by-step
  progress for kill-count or single-target missions, so none is shown
  for those. A known-bugged Frontier mission type ("Permit Acquisition
  Opportunity") that never closes on its own is filtered out
  automatically.
- **Mining Finder pins**: mark a system worth remembering and it sorts
  to the top of the results list and survives filter and session
  changes (stored per Commander profile).

### Fixed

- Exobiology's "Carried · Unsold" counter only reset on a Vista
  Genomics sale - a ship lost to destruction wipes unsold Exobiology
  data in-game too, but the counter kept counting it as still carried.
  It now also resets on a `Died` event.
- The Mining Finder's filter dropdowns and result list rebuilt on
  almost every Journal refresh (roughly every 1.2 seconds while
  flying), which could tear a dropdown's popup out from under an
  in-progress click and reset list scroll position back to the top
  mid-read. Both now refresh at a slower, throttled pace, never while
  one of the page's own popups is open or the list is being scrolled,
  and the list explicitly restores scroll position afterward.

## 1.5.7 — 2026-09-19

### Changed

- **Frontier Companion API re-registered under a new Client ID** as
  part of the ED-Frame rebrand (the Frontier developer portal entry
  itself was re-created rather than renamed in place). **Anyone with
  an existing Frontier CAPI login will be signed out once** and needs
  to re-authenticate from Settings → Connections - the old stored
  token was issued for the previous Client ID and Frontier will not
  refresh it under the new one. No other data (Journal, Wishlist,
  Materials, INARA, EDDN) is affected. The redirect endpoint
  (`https://cmdrforcer.github.io/oauth/callback.html`) is unchanged.

## 1.5.6 — 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- The published 1.5.5 release asset was built from the tag alone and
  never picked up the two follow-up commits merged onto `main`
  afterward (the new manuals, and the GitHub links updated after the
  repo rename) - the `release.yml` workflow only runs on a tag push,
  not on every push to `main`. Anyone downloading "latest release"
  got a correctly rebranded `ED-Frame.exe` but the old, un-rebranded
  PDF manuals bundled inside, and a `README.txt` still pointing at the
  old repo name. This release re-tags the current `main` so the
  published ZIP matches what the repository actually contains.

## 1.5.5 — 2026-09-18

### Changed

- Renamed the project from **ED Engineering Companion (EDEC)** to
  **ED-Frame** — the app, its window title, tray, About dialog, settings
  folder, packaged executable and release assets now use the new name.
  The Inara `appName`, the EDDN `softwareName`, and the Frontier CAPI
  client id/redirect URI/registered app name are deliberately left
  unchanged, since those are tied to external registrations. Existing
  installs migrate their settings folder automatically on first launch
  (copy, not move - the old folder is kept as a safety net); a stored
  Frontier OAuth token and Wishlist/Materials data carry over without a
  forced re-login. See the project README for the current name.
- The window title now shows just the version number - Windows already
  appends the application name to the taskbar tooltip on its own, so
  including it in the title too just showed it twice.
- Replaced the pre-rebrand English and German manuals with complete
  ED-Frame 1.5.5 editions and updated portable-build packaging to ship
  the new filenames.

## 1.5.4 — 2026-09-15

### Added

- Exobiology's Survey Target cards now show a found/open checklist for
  every organism on a body once a Detailed Surface Scan has confirmed
  its genus list - already-scanned species show ticked off and dimmed,
  still-missing ones show their name and credit value, so progress on
  a partly-worked body is visible at a glance instead of only the
  still-open leads.

## 1.5.3 — 2026-09-13

### Changed

- Internal maintainability refactor, no behavior change: `controller.py`
  had grown to ~8 520 lines - a single `CockpitController(QObject)`
  class with 169 Properties, 123 Slots, 36 Signals and 135 other
  methods. Split into eleven domain mixins (`controller_core.py`,
  `controller_inara.py`, `controller_eddn.py`,
  `controller_frontier_capi.py`, `controller_exobiology.py`,
  `controller_commander.py`, `controller_engineering.py`,
  `controller_fleet_materials.py`, `controller_navigation.py`,
  `controller_logbook.py`, `controller_ui_settings.py`,
  `controller_journal_health.py`), combined into the final
  `CockpitController` via multiple inheritance; `controller.py` itself
  is now ~2 600 lines. Unlike the equivalent `state.py` split
  (1.5.2), this is a single stateful Qt class rather than independent
  functions, so `__init__` setup for each domain stays in
  `CockpitController.__init__` wherever it was genuinely interleaved
  with another domain's setup - only the Property/Signal/Slot/method
  definitions move in those cases.
- Along the way, a systematic sweep for the "helper function still
  defined in the old file but only called from a newly-split-out
  module" bug class caught and fixed four real latent `NameError`s
  that the existing test suite had not exercised
  (`_last_complete_json_record`, `_eddn_relay_relevant`,
  `ENGINEER_SYSTEMS`, `THEME_IDS`/`LEGACY_THEME_IDS`).

## 1.5.2 — 2026-09-13

### Changed

- Internal maintainability refactor, no behavior change: `state.py` had
  grown to ~7 950 lines covering eight unrelated domains (engineering
  wishlist/craft-tracking, materials, fleet/loadout, logbook,
  commander/CAPI-merge, Powerplay, engineer routing, and Operations
  action-selection). Split into eight focused modules
  (`state_core.py`, `state_materials.py`, `state_fleet.py`,
  `state_logbook.py`, `state_engineering.py`,
  `state_engineering_routing.py`, `state_engineering_operations.py`,
  `state_commander.py`); `state.py` itself is now ~1 200 lines and
  re-exports every name it used to define directly, so nothing outside
  it needed to change. Verified with the full test suite (437 tests)
  and the QML smoke test after every single extraction step.

## 1.5.1 — 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Engineer-name matching for `EngineerContribution` events relied on a
  hardcoded fix for the one known case of Frontier splicing an in-fiction
  nickname into the Journal's `Engineer` field (`"Tod 'The Blaster'
  McQuinn"` vs. the catalog's `"Tod McQuinn"`). It now matches whenever
  the catalog name's words all appear, in order, anywhere in the
  Journal-reported name, so any future engineer Frontier does the same to
  resolves automatically instead of needing a new one-off patch.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-09-13

### Added

- A GENUS PROGRESS panel on the Exobiology page shows how many of the
  known biological genera the Commander has found at least one species
  of, with a "SHOW MISSING" toggle listing the missing genera by name -
  answering "what have I found, and what's still missing?" directly.
- The species catalog now learns from the Commander's own
  `SellOrganicData` sales: any species the bundled catalog doesn't
  already carry is added automatically, using the exact base value
  Frontier actually paid, so the catalog only grows more complete the
  more the Commander plays. A learned entry carries no spawn-condition
  rules of its own, so it is only ever recognized once found again -
  never predicted onto an unscanned body.
- Acquired 3 species missing from the bundled catalog (Bark Mound,
  Amphora Plant, Radicoida Unicus) from the same community reference
  data already used elsewhere in the catalog, bringing it to 118
  species across 22 genera.

### Fixed

- A duplicate, dead catalog row for Stratum Aranaemus (keyed under its
  own standalone, self-referential codex key with no spawn-condition
  data instead of the shared Stratum genus key its correctly-keyed
  sibling row already used) inflated the genus count everywhere by one
  phantom "genus" that could never be found, and - before a related fix
  to species-candidate matching - would have falsely predicted onto
  every single landing target since an empty ruleset list matched any
  body. Removed the dead duplicate and kept the correctly keyed row.

## 1.4.3 — 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- A long body name on a Survey Target card (e.g. "Phylur PY-Z d13-56 A 2
  e") was truncated with an ellipsis even though the card had unused
  vertical space. The name now wraps onto up to two lines instead of
  eliding on one, while the CONFIRMED/PREDICTED badge stays pinned to
  the top-right corner.

## 1.4.2 — 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- REMAINING ON THIS PLANET could report an implausibly high count (e.g.
  32) at a body with only a handful of real signals. It was counting
  every catalog *species* matching the body's confirmed or predicted
  genera - one genus alone can list over a dozen species - rather than
  distinct organisms. It now counts distinct genera, capped at the
  body's own FSS-detected signal count, since a body can never hold more
  organisms than it has detected signals.

## 1.4.1 — 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Survey Target cards could spill text and badges past the card's own
  edge into the next card - a body name, the CONFIRMED/PREDICTED badge,
  or the new FOOTFALL BONUS POSSIBLE badge. Qt Quick Layouts do not
  shrink a text item below its own unelided width unless
  `Layout.minimumWidth` is capped explicitly, so `elide` never actually
  triggered for a long body name. The FOOTFALL BONUS POSSIBLE badge also
  no longer shares a row with the signal count - the two together did
  not fit a card's width for a body with more than one signal.

## 1.4.0 — 2026-09-13

### Added

- Exobiology page redesign, replacing two career-wide, non-actionable
  stats with ones scoped to what the Commander can actually act on:
  - **DISTANCE TO NEXT SAMPLE** now leads the page, above the stat tiles
    - the live "what do I do right now" moment comes first.
  - **LIFETIME EARNED** replaces `COMPLETE`: the sum of every real
    `SellOrganicData` sale's `Value` plus `Bonus` across the whole
    career - what Exobiology has actually paid out, not a derived count.
    Shows the Commander's best-ever single find underneath.
  - **REMAINING ON THIS PLANET** replaces `IN PROGRESS`: how many of the
    biological signals detected at the body the Commander is currently
    standing on are still unclaimed, instead of a career-wide count with
    no connection to where they are right now.
  - Survey Target cards show a **FOOTFALL BONUS POSSIBLE** badge when
    the Commander has not personally landed there yet and the system
    carries no recorded population - a pre-filter, never a promise:
    whether another Commander has already landed there first is not
    knowable from a local Journal at all, so it is never added into a
    promised total.

## 1.3.2 — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- The intermittent "Cannot create delegate" QML runtime error - previously
  believed to be a rare, unexplained flake affecting the Engineering
  page's slot list - is now understood and fixed. Qt Quick reports a
  lazily-unloaded page's ListView aborting an in-flight delegate
  incubation as two separate diagnostics: a delegate-creation failure and
  an "object or context destroyed during incubation" message for the
  same single benign event, but does not guarantee which of the two it
  emits first. The existing filter only recognized the teardown message
  arriving *before* the failure; the reverse order - observed at least as
  often - was misreported as a real error, which is what surfaced as an
  unreliable, hard-to-reproduce test failure. The filter now recognizes
  the pair in either order.

## 1.3.1 — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- The live "distance to next sample" check on the Exobiology page never
  actually appeared. It resolved the Commander's current system from
  `self._state["currentSystemAddress"]`, a value only ever set transiently
  by the live-location merge and wiped again by the very next full state
  refresh - which happens within a fraction of a second, so the field was
  essentially always empty by the time the check read it. It now resolves
  the current system fresh from the Journal on every poll, the same
  reliable way Survey Targets already does.

## 1.3.0 — 2026-09-12

### Added

- **EXOBIOLOGY**: a new page tracking biological scan progress entirely from
  the Journal's own `ScanOrganic`, `FSSBodySignals`, `SAASignalsFound` and
  `Scan` events.
  - Per-species scan progress (Log/Sample/Analyse) with the confirmed
    catalog value, correctly separated by system even when two systems
    happen to share the same body number.
  - **Survey Targets**: which body in the Commander's current system still
    has an unclaimed biological signal, with likely species predicted from
    a confirmed DSS genus or planetary conditions when no DSS scan exists
    yet. A signal stays a visible target until fully analysed - starting
    it does not make it disappear. The full career-wide list stays one
    click away.
  - **THIS SESSION** and **CARRIED · UNSOLD** value tracking, scoped by the
    most recent `LoadGame` and `SellOrganicData` events respectively - the
    latter spans sessions on purpose, since unsold data stays in the ship
    until it is actually sold at a Vista Genomics terminal.
  - A live **distance to next sample** check for the species currently
    being sampled: great-circle distance on the body's own radius from
    `Status.json`, compared against the genus' colony-range minimum.
  - A short activity alert the instant a fresh, unclaimed biological
    signal appears in the Commander's current system.
  - Reference data (`ed_data/exobiology_species.json`,
    `ed_data/exobiology_colony_ranges.json`) is EDEC's own re-expression of
    public game facts, not copied code; colony-range distances are
    separately sourced from the Elite Dangerous Fandom wiki (CC BY-SA),
    attributed in `README.md`.

## 1.2.6 — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- A fully-crafted Experimental Effect could stay stuck showing "Experimental
  pending" forever, with its material recipe reported as unresolved, even
  though the correct effect was genuinely installed and the craft had
  already been tracked. The Journal's Loadout event names some Experimental
  Effects with a trailing plural ("Super Capacitors") that the EngineerCraft
  catalog and every EngineerCraft event itself spell singular ("Super
  Capacitor"); comparing them exactly treated that spelling gap as "a
  different effect is installed" and reverted the plan's confirmed
  completion back to pending on every refresh. Effect names are now
  compared tolerant of that trailing "s", for every Experimental Effect on
  every module, not only the one this was first found on.

## 1.2.5 — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- A ship's registered type could silently change on its own between
  sessions - for example "Caspian Explorer" flipping to "Explorer Nx" -
  whenever a Journal entry lacked Frontier's localized ship name. The
  fallback guessed a display name from the internal symbol, which only
  spells out the real name for hulls whose symbol happens to look like
  it (most do not: `Asp` is "Asp Explorer", `Explorer_NX` is "Caspian
  Explorer"). Ship type now resolves against the full `ed_data/ships.json`
  catalog first, which already carries the correct name for every hull
  EDEC knows; only a hull missing from the catalog falls back to the old
  guess. A relabeled ship's existing wishlist and history stay attached
  by ship ID, as before. A player's client-language Journal localization
  still takes priority when present.

## 1.2.4 — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Operations could send the Commander back to trade or collect materials
  right after finishing a Grade roll or Experimental on an already
  in-progress plan, purely because some other, completely untouched plan
  elsewhere in the wishlist was still missing a material with a trade
  available. A plan already underway and material-ready right now is no
  longer deferred by an unrelated plan's outstanding trade, collection,
  ambiguous binding, unconfirmed loadout, or pending installation - those
  gates are for before any engineering has started; once a plan is
  actually in progress, its own readiness decides, not the rest of the
  backlog. A plan's own such gap still blocks it as before.

## 1.2.3 — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Operations' "Next Best Action" could recommend a completely untouched
  engineering plan over one already underway - for example jumping to a
  Thrusters upgrade that was never started while a partially-rolled
  Armour upgrade sat one Grade short of its target - whenever the
  untouched plan's engineer happened to fall earlier in the overall
  travel route. Route order is now only a tie-break between plans of the
  same urgency: any plan already in progress, or only waiting on its
  planned Experimental, is always recommended before a not-yet-started
  one, regardless of which engineer is closer. Affects every ship,
  blueprint and engineer route.

## 1.2.2 — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- The Materials page's stock bars could rebuild and re-fill themselves
  several times in a row after a single jump, as if refreshing over and
  over. Every completed Journal poll unconditionally told the UI that
  materials, the wishlist, the fleet, and every other tracked domain had
  all changed - even when a plain `FSDJump` (whose Journal lines often
  land in more than one debounced refresh) left materials and the
  wishlist byte-for-byte the same. QML then treated the unchanged list as
  a brand-new model, tearing down and recreating every bar's delegate and
  replaying its fill-in animation. Materials and the wishlist now only
  notify the UI when their own data actually changed.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Importing a build whose `Ship` field is the raw Frontier/Coriolis hull
  symbol (e.g. `Explorer_NX`) instead of the display name shown in the
  fleet (`Caspian Explorer`) was rejected as "incompatible with target
  ship", even though it names the exact same hull. Ship-type matching now
  resolves against the full `ed_data/ships.json` catalog's symbol-to-name
  pairs for every hull EDEC knows, not only the small, hand-picked list of
  base-game exceptions it previously relied on.
- Applying a build import, or pinning an engineering plan a second time,
  could add a duplicate wishlist entry for the same physical module
  instead of recognizing it as already tracked. The de-duplication check
  compared the plan's exact remaining-roll snapshot, which shifts as soon
  as any progress is made in-game; re-applying the same target afterward
  no longer matched and was added again. Plans are now identified by their
  physical target (ship, slot, module, blueprint, target grade) instead,
  which stays stable as progress advances. Affects every ship and both the
  build-import Apply and the manual "pin to wishlist" action.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-09-11

### Added

- **Interface Activity** on the Diagnostics page: a merged, newest-first
  record of what was actually sent to or received from INARA, EDDN and the
  Frontier Companion API, and when — service, direction, a short summary
  (schema name / operation), and a timestamp. Only completed deliveries
  are listed; in-flight/retrying/failed EDDN jobs keep their existing live
  view on the Connections page. Every field is already public-safe (schema
  names, HTTP outcomes, operation labels) — never raw message content.

### Changed

- INARA auto-sync now batches at least every 3 minutes instead of 5
  (`INARA_MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL_SECONDS` 300 → 180). The burst limit
  (2 requests/minute) and the 429 cooldown are unchanged, so a real rate
  limit from INARA is still respected automatically.
- The INARA card's startup detail text now reflects whether an API key and
  consent were already saved, instead of always showing the generic
  first-run message — the same fix applied to EDDN's card in 1.1.8.

## 1.1.8 — 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- The Connections page's EDDN card could show `ENABLED` next to "EDDN
  network access is disabled." on every startup where EDDN was already
  enabled from a previous session. The status badge was always computed
  live from the saved consent flag, but the detail text under it was
  hardcoded to the disabled message at controller start, regardless of
  what was actually loaded from disk.

## 1.1.7 — 2026-09-11

### Changed

- The system tray icon, tooltip and menu ("Open ED·OPS", "Exit ED·OPS",
  "Restart ED·OPS", the "still running" notice) used a leftover "ED·OPS"
  name from before the project was named. They now say EDEC, matching the
  app's window title, About dialog, and the identity it already sends to
  INARA and EDDN ("ED Engineering Companion").

## 1.1.6 — 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- The system tray's "Status" line got permanently stuck on whatever
  one-shot toast last fired (e.g. "WINDOW OPEN · Windows autostart
  enabled.") instead of showing anything about the Journal watcher it
  claims to report on, because it reused `controller.activity` - designed
  as a transient action confirmation, not a persistent status. It now
  shows the live Journal health (`LIVE`/`READY`/`ERROR`/`NO JOURNAL`).

## 1.1.5 — 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- The CMDR finance ticker could raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if ever asked
  to downsample its history to a single point (`limit=1`); it now returns
  the most recent point instead of dividing by zero. Not reachable through
  today's UI (the only caller uses the default limit of 180), fixed as a
  latent landmine found during a full manual code review.

### Changed

- Closing pass of the full manual code-quality review started in 1.1.2:
  read every module under `ed_companion/`, including the two largest
  files (`state.py`, `controller.py`) in targeted high-risk slices
  (journal caching/rewrite detection, engineer-craft reconciliation, the
  EDDN and INARA privacy-filtering pipelines, engineering-slot
  projection), plus whole-codebase mechanical scans (ruff's correctness
  ruleset, duplicate-line detection, dead-code-after-return detection,
  None/bool comparison anti-patterns). No further defects found beyond
  the fix above; several suspected issues were investigated and confirmed
  correct as written.

## 1.1.4 — 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- The unconfirmed-trader warning ("Unverified – confirm on site") was
  hardcoded German text handed straight to Main.qml's display binding, so
  it showed untranslated in every interface language, including English.
  It is now a translation key resolved through the same catalog as the
  rest of the interface, with entries in all four supported languages.

## 1.1.3 — 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- The engineering overlay no longer fails to start if its saved position
  was ever recorded as `null` (e.g. a hand-edited or partially written
  `overlay_settings.json`); it now falls back to the default corner like a
  missing value already did.
- Spansh trader lookups now pace requests consistently: `fetch_nearest_traders`
  was missing the pause every other multi-request lookup in the same module
  applies, and `fetch_trader_catalog_updates` was pausing twice per request
  instead of once.

### Changed

- First slice of a full manual code-quality pass: removed a stray
  `__import__("os")`, an unused loop-ordinal variable, and two duplicated
  `_pause_between_requests` calls. No behaviour change beyond the two fixes
  above.

## 1.1.2 — 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- The engineering view's **installed roll panel** and the automatic current
  grade selection now work. `_apply_installed_slot_engineering` computed the
  installed blueprint, grade, quality and experimental of the selected slot
  but a misplaced early `return` left the code that applies them unreachable
  — dead since 1.0.0. A regression test now covers it.

### Changed

- Internal tidy: removed dead local variables and two unused imports, folded
  a duplicated sort/merge path in the CAPI fleet merge, hoisted the ship-type
  name table to a module constant. No behaviour change from these.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-09-10

### Added

- When this machine has never seen a Journal `Loadout` for the active ship
  (fresh install, ship engineered on another PC, rotated Journal files), the
  install-before-engineering guard now reads the ship's modules from the
  Frontier CAPI profile instead of blocking every plan with
  `MODULE · INSTALLATION REQUIRED`. Blueprint conflict detection works from
  the CAPI loadout too.
- The priority is Journal `Loadout` → CAPI loadout → unknown. A Journal
  loadout always wins; without a CAPI connection the behaviour is unchanged.
  CAPI-sourced slots are marked so the UI can show the profile snapshot
  time. Within-grade roll quality is treated as unknown, exactly as it is
  for a Journal `Loadout` that omits it.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-09-10

### Added

- The Frontier CAPI profile snapshot now also imports the **stored fleet**:
  every ship Frontier knows about, with its current system and station,
  hull/module value and total value. Ships already seen in the Journal keep
  their Journal identity; ships only Frontier knows are added as remote
  rows and never overwrite or delete Journal fleet entries.
- Commander **ranks** (Combat, Trade, Exploration, CQC, Federation, Empire,
  Mercenary, Exobiology) are filled from the CAPI profile when the Journal
  has not established them yet. A Journal rank is never downgraded, and rank
  progress and reputation are not part of the CAPI profile.
- A **rebuy estimate** and hull/module value for the active ship, derived
  from the CAPI ship value when the Journal offers none.

### Changed

- CAPI-only ship type names now split camelCase (`PantherMkII` reads as
  `Panther Clipper Mk II`); a few current-generation hulls were added to the
  readable-name table.
- All of the above only augments local Journal and Status.json data; newer
  Journal observations stay authoritative and survive a state rebuild.

## 1.0.4 — 2026-09-10

### Added

- The Frontier CAPI tab now requires an explicit consent tick before the
  first login. The choice is stored per Commander profile; clearing it
  cancels any pending login and leaves existing local tokens untouched.
- `EDEC_FRONTIER_CLIENT_ID` and `EDEC_FRONTIER_REDIRECT_URI` let an operator
  who runs their own instance point EDEC at a self-registered OAuth client
  instead of the bundled one.

### Changed

- The authorization request now asks for `audience=all`, matching Frontier's
  documented default, so Steam, Epic, Xbox and PSN logins all resolve.

### Fixed

- A Frontier `error` / `error_description` returned to the OAuth callback is
  now shown on the Connections tab instead of a generic "authorization was
  not completed". An error whose `state` does not match echoes only the
  bounded error code, never unverified free text.

## 1.0.3 — 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- The Frontier CAPI tab can no longer strand itself in a permanent
  "CONTACTING FRONTIER…" state. An unexpected error inside the background
  worker now always reports back with a privacy-safe message instead of
  silently ending the thread, and a watchdog releases the tab if a request
  still never returns. Connect, Refresh and Disconnect stay usable.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-09-10

### Added

- Opt-in Frontier Companion API connection on the Connections page. A new
  FRONTIER CAPI tab authorises through Frontier's PKCE OAuth flow (no shared
  secret), then imports an authenticated Commander profile snapshot —
  currently credits and the active ship — on demand via Connect, Refresh and
  Disconnect.
- Frontier OAuth tokens are encrypted for the current Windows account with
  DPAPI and stored outside the diagnostics log; they never appear in Journal
  data, logs or Git.
- The hosted GitHub Pages callback returns the authorisation response to the
  running desktop instance through the `edec://` handler and the existing
  single-instance channel, so an in-progress login is never handed to a
  second process.

### Changed

- Frontier CAPI data only augments local Journal and Status.json values;
  newer Journal observations always remain authoritative. Imported profile
  fields survive a Journal-driven state rebuild without overwriting fleet
  entries or engineering plans.

## 1.0.1 — 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Remote ships whose current loadout has not been observed are no longer
  mistaken for ships with confirmed empty or mismatched slots. Operations now
  asks for a Journal loadout confirmation before recommending installation.
- The Credits chart no longer draws an artificial Assets series, legend or
  right-hand scale when no authoritative asset snapshot is available.
- Standalone QML delegate failures remain visible in diagnostics while the
  known paired delegate-incubation teardown noise is suppressed narrowly.

### Changed

- Refreshed the application with the Orbital Dawn visual design and expanded
  the public documentation and screenshots.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-09

First public release of ED Engineering Companion under versioned releases.

### Ship engineering

- Slot-based engineering for every supported hull: Core Internal, Optional
  Internal, Hardpoint, Utility Mount and Limpet/Controller layouts are the
  ship's own.
- Fleet-wide planning — select any ship EDEC has seen in the Journal without
  switching to it in Elite Dangerous.
- Journal-confirmed blueprints, grades and experimental effects are shown on
  the exact physical module slot they belong to; pinned plans stay attached
  to the slot when other catalog blueprints are viewed.
- Install-before-engineering guard: when a planned module is missing from its
  bound slot, Operations shows `MODULE · INSTALLATION REQUIRED` and pauses the
  material and engineering flow until a Journal `Loadout` confirms the module.

### Wishlist, materials and navigation

- Actionable Wishlist: material readiness, craft progress, Engineer
  destinations and trader routes derived from the selected ship and its
  pinned plans.
- Live Raw / Manufactured / Encoded inventory with protected build stock,
  verified acquisition guidance and nearest-vs-Journal-confirmed trader
  routing.
- Engineer navigation: searchable capability index, Journal-backed unlock
  state, guided prerequisite chains, and Human/Guardian Technology Broker
  tracking.

### Commander tools

- CMDR overview with a persistent live Credits ticker and finance timeline
  built from a lossless local history archive; genuine `LIVE STATUS` balance
  changes are persisted, a session-start fallback is not.
- Logbook sessions and notes, State Finds, live High-Grade Emission
  assistance, and configurable navigation.
- Powerplay 2.0 view derived entirely from observed Journal values.
- Four interface languages: English, German, Spanish, French.

### Interchange and community

- Import EDEC, EDSY/SLEF and Coriolis builds through exact hull-slot
  validation; export outfitting with physical slot identities intact.
- Optional, opt-in INARA synchronization and privacy-filtered EDDN
  contributions with offline-aware queues and retry handling.
- A source checkout reports itself to INARA and EDDN as a development build.

### Engineering and reliability

- Atomic local persistence with corruption quarantine, bounded history,
  multi-process protection and durable retry queues.
- Background Journal projection kept off the Qt thread; all periodic timers
  stop on shutdown before the final save.
- Headless load of the real `Main.qml` in the test suite so QML runtime
  errors fail the build; full suite plus a source and packaged smoke test
  run on every release.
